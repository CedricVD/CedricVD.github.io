        <p class="css-center">
            <em>Our first project involved creating a game of MasterMind.
                <br> As a group of 4 students, we had a couple of months to create a working version of the popular game
                calledMasterMind</em>

        <div class="css-row">

                <p>
                    Before we started working on this project, we split it in 7 functionalities. We made a rough
                    analysis of each functionality, so we could go more in-depth afterwards.
                    <br><br>We used Java for the implementation. This was the first programming language we learned,
                    therefore it was our only option.
                    One of the major advantages of Java, is the ease-of-use. After a while, we noticed that Java can be
                    pretty hard to keep readable and structured.
                    <br><br>
                    The first functionalities went without breaking a sweat, but after a while, it became harder and we
                    noticed our implementation wasn't good enough. We had to rewrite a good chuck of the code, but this
                    meant we were behind on schedule.
                    To fix this problem, we split our team in half. One half was going to implement the rest of the
                    code, the other half was going to clean up the mess.
                    This caused a lot of miscommunication, but in the end it worked out pretty well. We managed to
                    deliver a working product.

        <p class="css-center">
            <em> Our second project, was commissioned by Taijitan Yoshin Ryu, a Jiu Jitsu club from Ghent.
                <br> The commission was to create a webtool which can be managed via an administrator-tool.<br>
                Clubmembers could look up lessons for their grade via the webtool and register their attendance
                efficiently.</em>

            <div class="css-col m8 css-padding-large">
                <p>This was our first project for an external party. It was also the first project which consisted of 2
                    seperate projects: the webtool and the admin-tool. <br><br>For this project, we used iterations.
                    Every 2 weeks there was a planned date and time, where we could talk about our progress and ask if
                    anything can, or needs to be, changed.
                    The webtool was created in ASP.NET, the administrator-tool in Java. ASP.Net was something we only
                    recently learned about. In the beginning it all went really slow since we still had to figure out
                    how to do certain functionalities in ASP.NET, but after a few weeks, it went better and better and
                    we learned a lot of new things.
                    <br><br>The administrator-tool was also something new. We were used to working in Java, but since we
                    already had an existing database as a result of our ASP.NET application, we had to practice a lot
                    before we managed to integrate our existing SQL Server database, into our Java application.
                    <br><br> Our application was pretty good. It wasn't flawless, but it certainly wasn't terrible
                    either. Editing our database had proven to be our biggest obstacle since we all had different
                    settings without knowing, this was a result of using different software across all computers.
                    In the future, I'll try to focus more on making sure everyone has the same setup, so that mistakes
                    like this can be avoided.

            <em> Horizon Cruiser is my personal project, which I started in the autumn of 2018.
                <br>It is a game, developed in Unity. The game is based on Temple Run and Subway Surfers. The core
                aspect of the game are the neon colours, since it is based on an 80s retro theme.</em>

            <div class="css-col m8 css-padding-large">
                <p>I started this project as a result of my interest in Unity and game development. I had zero
                    experience with Unity, but the development of a game was something I always wanted to give a try.
                    The theme of the game was a coincidence. I wanted to make something which wasn't too difficult since
                    I wanted to start slowly. Subway Surfers uses a lot of basic inputs, so I based my work around that
                    game. After a while, more and more elements were added to my project, and I wanted to give it my own
                    twist.
                    Since I love retro themed sci-fi books, I used that as my inspiration.
                    <br><br>At this moment, the game is still in development. A friend of mine who specialises in the 3D
                    artwork is currently taking a foreign internship. As a result, the development has been postponed.

                <p>This project was the first 'large-scale' project that I had ever worked on. Since it was our first Android-based application, there were quite a lot of quirks and bugs we had to solve.
                    Because of the size of the project, we also had an increased team-size. This proved more difficult than we thought since coördinating was a lot harder now that there were also more people involved.
                    To solve this issue, we split the group in half and assigned one part to the Android application, while the other half worked on the Angular application. Occasionally, we would switch roles, so that everyone was up-to-date on the changes in each project. 
                    This was also necessary so that everyone knew what part of the SQL database was used for which part of the project. <br><br>
                    The result of this project was the best result I had to that date. Except for a few small oversights, there were no bugs. The client was very satisfied and the code we wrote was easy to maintain.
